This is a premium project challenge that I accepted from frontendmentor.io

This is an Entertainment Web App where users can view and look up their favorite movies and tv shows and see all kinds of info about them. Users can also make and account and log in on my web app. users with accounts will be able to review and rate movies and tv shows in the future. All info about the movies comes from the tmdb api. Learn more about tmdb here: https://www.themoviedb.org/

I've Learned a lot when making this project but some of the biggest things I've learned were:

1. how to create and authenticate users on my site with firebase.
2. how to verify email addresses that users try to sign up with and prevent them from using their account until they verify their email address.
3. how to work with the tmdb api to display and filter through data on each page (search pagination).
4. how to use axios to make multiple requests for displaying data on load.
5. how to use useEffect to make certain actions to happen syncronously with state.

Even though I'm proud of this project, I know it's not perfect and there are a lot of changes that I can make. Here are some that I need to make:

1. Find a way to improve performance (it was showing to be a 75 average for lighthouse/performance from my testing on desktop).
2. Implement the review feature using firebase/firestore.
3. Add a unique profile picture for each user that has an account and is logged in.
4. refactor the code (specifically the css and context files). to be easier to read for me and others.

screenshots are coming in the future.
